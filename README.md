# ableton-clone

This is a website template that serves as a replica of the Ableton website. It was developed by me to assess and showcase my proficiency in HTML and CSS.
The template has been designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes. During the process of creating this template,
I gained a comprehensive understanding of flex layouts, responsive image techniques, and Bootstrap framework.

Here are some screenshots
